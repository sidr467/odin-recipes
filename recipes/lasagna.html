    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Lazy Lasagna recipe serves us both a shortcut weeknight dinner and an easy entertaining hack. Cheesy and delicious, no one will know you pulled this together in 5 minutes with 3 store-bought ingredients. I’m hesitant to even share this recipe, because I don’t want you to know how easy this was if you come to my house for dinner.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>    
        <li>Store-bought ravioli</li>
        <li>Jarred marinara sauce</li>
        <li>Grated mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the marinara sauce in a baking dish. Top with a handful of cheese, then a layer of ravioli. Repeat with another layer of ravioli and sauce, and finish with remaining mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with aluminum foil for the first part of baking to cook the ravioli through and melt the cheese. Uncover and bake until cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        
    </ol>
