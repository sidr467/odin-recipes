        <p>This Lazy Lasagna recipe serves us both a shortcut weeknight dinner and an easy entertaining hack. Cheesy and delicious, no one will know you pulled this together in 5 minutes with 3 store-bought ingredients. I’m hesitant to even share this recipe, because I don’t want you to know how easy this was if you come to my house for dinner.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the marinara sauce in a baking dish. Top with a handful of cheese, then a layer of ravioli. Repeat with another layer of ravioli and sauce, and finish with remaining mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Cover the pan with aluminum foil for the first part of baking to cook the ravioli through and melt the cheese. Uncover and bake until cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
